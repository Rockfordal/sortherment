## purescript-thermite starter


Just an attempt of a starter-project for Thermite
To make it easier to get something running

All source comes from paf31/purescript-thermite
The module in test folder was renamed to Main
Added some scripts (found in halogen projects)


## Install (Linux/OSX)

```
./inst
```


## Build

```
./dev
```

## Start Server

```
./start
```


p.s. I have no expertice in Purescript or relation with any source here
